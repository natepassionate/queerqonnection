Through online consultations and interactive sessions, he takes the time to understand his clients’ needs, preferences, and goals, offering solutions that are practical and sustainable.</li>



<li><strong>Mindful Eating</strong>: Ricky advocates for mindful eating—being present and aware of what you are eating, how it makes you feel, and how it impacts your health. This approach helps people form a healthier relationship with food and avoid the pitfalls of emotional or mindless eating.</li>



<li><strong>Sustainable Wellness</strong>: Rather than promoting quick fixes or fad diets, Ricky encourages long-term, sustainable wellness practices. He teaches people to make healthier choices in the context of their daily lives, whether it’s cooking at home, making better choices at restaurants, or finding ways to stay active while juggling work and family.</li>
