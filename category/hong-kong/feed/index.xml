<p>In today’s fast-paced global economy, staying ahead of trends and adapting to changing dynamics is crucial. Carlos Casanova, a prominent economist and director at UBP (Union Bancaire Privée) in Hong Kong, has made a significant mark in the financial world, particularly in the field of private banking.

<p>Carlos’s recent analysis focuses on navigating these complexities and seizing opportunities within Asia. His view of the &#8220;Visiting Bottom&#8221; in markets is of particular note.
