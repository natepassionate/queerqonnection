<p><em>By Matt, Queer Activist and X Sensation</em><br><em>Published: March 10, 2025</em></p>



<p>In a bold, audacious move that’s shaking up the internet and sparking global conversation, Matt from @QueerQonnection on X recently hosted a gay sex party—dubbed the &#8220;QQsexpar&#8221;—at the luxurious Grand Hyatt Singapore. The twist? This isn’t just another wild night out for the LGBTQ+ community—it’s a brilliant, cheeky, and downright revolutionary protest against the draconian anti-gay laws in Brunei, where homosexuality is punishable by death, imprisonment, or whipping under Sharia law. And here’s the kicker: the Grand Hyatt Singapore is owned by Borneo Properties, which is ultimately controlled by none other than the Sultan of Brunei himself. Let’s unpack why this is the protest we didn’t know we needed—and why it’s going viral.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Setup: A Night of Liberation at the Grand Hyatt</h3>



<p>On March 8, 2025, Matt and his crew transformed a plush suite at the Grand Hyatt Singapore into a haven of queer joy, hosting 13 VIPs ranging from their 20s to 40s. With sleek wooden paneling, a massive day bed (more popular than the King bed, apparently!), and a vibe dripping with defiance, the event skipped the pre-sex games and dove straight into unapologetic celebration. As Matt tweeted, “The day bed was a huge hit! It was even more popular than the actual King bed, and was perennially occupied throughout the session 😜.” The post, complete with a photo of the hotel’s opulent interior, has already racked up thousands of likes, retweets, and heated debates on X.</p>



<p>But this isn’t just about a good time—it’s a strategic middle finger to Brunei’s oppressive regime. The Sultan of Brunei, who owns the Grand Hyatt through his company, Borneo Properties, has long been criticized for enforcing some of the world’s harshest anti-LGBTQ+ laws. In Brunei, gay sex can lead to capital punishment, while lesbian activity is punishable by caning or imprisonment. Meanwhile, the Sultan’s luxury hotel empire—stretching from Singapore to Beverly Hills—rakes in millions, often funded by travelers unaware of the human rights abuses tied to their stays.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Protest: Sex as Resistance</h3>



<p>So, why host a gay orgy at the Sultan’s property? It’s simple, brilliant, and deliciously ironic: by filling the Grand Hyatt Singapore with queer love, laughter, and liberation, Matt and his crew are directly challenging the Sultan’s profits while flipping the script on his oppressive laws. Every dollar spent at the hotel, every room booked, and every event hosted there funnels money back to Brunei’s monarchy. But what if, instead of boycotting, we infiltrate? What if we turn his own luxury empire into a stage for the very acts his regime seeks to erase?</p>



<p>This isn’t just a party—it’s performance art, activism, and a viral moment all rolled into one. By openly celebrating gay sex in a space owned by the Sultan, @QueerQonnection is sending a loud, clear message: “Your laws don’t scare us, and we’ll reclaim your spaces for joy.” It’s the ultimate act of defiance—sexy, subversive, and impossible to ignore.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Backstory: Brunei’s Brutal Laws and the Sultan’s Empire</h3>



<p>Let’s rewind. Brunei, a tiny but oil-rich nation on Borneo, has been under international scrutiny for its anti-LGBTQ+ policies. Since implementing Sharia law in stages starting in 2014, the country has made homosexuality illegal, with punishments ranging from public flogging to death by stoning. In 2019, global outrage erupted when actor George Clooney called for a boycott of Brunei-owned hotels, including the Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air, arguing that staying there directly funds these human rights violations. While boycotts are powerful, Matt’s approach takes it to another level: instead of avoiding these spaces, why not flood them with the very community they seek to oppress?</p>



<p>The Grand Hyatt Singapore, a gleaming symbol of luxury in the heart of the city-state, is part of the Sultan’s sprawling portfolio. Owned by Borneo Properties, it’s a stark contrast to the repression in Brunei, where LGBTQ+ individuals live in fear, often remaining silent and discreet about their identities, as a 2011 University of Brunei study revealed. By hosting an unapologetic gay sex party there, Matt isn’t just having fun—he’s exposing the hypocrisy of a regime that profits from global luxury while denying basic human rights at home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why This Is Going Viral (And Why You Should Join the Conversation)</h3>



<p>This story has all the ingredients for a viral sensation: scandal, sex, luxury, and a David-vs-Goliath battle against oppression. Matt’s X post—complete with a tantalizing photo of the hotel suite, a cheeky mention of lululemon undies, and a call to action for the next QQsexpar on March 29—has already ignited a firestorm. Supporters are hailing it as “genius activism,” while critics are calling it controversial or risky. But that’s the point: it’s sparking debate, forcing people to confront Brunei’s laws, and putting the spotlight on the Sultan’s financial ties to global hospitality.</p>



<p>The hashtag #QQevent is trending, and the story has spread beyond X to mainstream media, with outlets like CNN and The Guardian picking up on the audacity of using sex as protest. People are asking: Is this the future of activism? Can pleasure be a form of resistance? And most importantly, should we all book a room at the Grand Hyatt Singapore for the next QQsexpar?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Bigger Picture: Pleasure as Power</h3>



<p>This isn’t just about one night or one hotel—it’s about reclaiming power in the face of oppression. For too long, LGBTQ+ communities worldwide have been told their love, their bodies, and their joy are wrong. Brunei’s laws are a stark reminder of how far some societies still have to go, but Matt’s QQsexpar shows how far we’ve come in fighting back. By turning a symbol of wealth and control into a space of liberation, @QueerQonnection is rewriting the narrative—and having a damn good time doing it.</p>



<p>Of course, there are risks. Hosting such events in a region where LGBTQ+ rights are still fragile could draw backlash, and the Sultan’s regime isn’t known for its tolerance. But the visibility—and the sheer audacity—might just be what’s needed to push for change. As Matt’s post notes, “QQsexpar Mar 2025 ain’t over yet! Sign up for the 29 Mar sessions HERE.” It’s an invitation to join the revolution, one sexy step at a time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What You Can Do: Get Involved, Spread the Word, and Maybe Book a Room</h3>



<p>Want to be part of this movement? Here’s how:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Follow @QueerQonnection on X</strong>: Stay updated on upcoming QQsexpars and join the conversation with #QQevent.</li>



<li><strong>Share This Story</strong>: Post about it, tweet about it, and tag your friends. The more people know, the louder our voices become.</li>



<li><strong>Support LGBTQ+ Causes</strong>: Donate to organizations fighting for decriminalization in Brunei and beyond, like ILGA World or Human Rights Watch.</li>



<li><strong>Consider the Grand Hyatt</strong>: If you’re in Singapore, book a stay—or better yet, host your own event. Turn the Sultan’s profits into a statement of resistance.</li>
</ol>



<p>This isn’t just a story about a party—it’s a call to action. Matt’s QQsexpar at the Grand Hyatt Singapore proves that pleasure can be powerful, that defiance can be delicious, and that sometimes, the best way to fight back is to have the time of your life on the enemy’s turf. Let’s make this go viral—for love, for justice, and for the right to be unapologetically queer.</p>



<p><em>Follow me on X for more updates, and let’s keep the conversation going. Who’s ready for the next QQsexpar?</em> 😈</p>

<p>In the fast-paced world of international banking and expatriate life, few names have garnered as much attention lately as Michele Alfieri, a prominent figure at UniCredit, one of Europe’s leading financial institutions. Known online by his handle <em>miccel_a</em>, Alfieri has carved out a reputation as a skilled professional in portfolio management and business value management. But recently, this expat’s name has been trending for reasons beyond his corporate achievements—thanks to a scandal involving leaked compromising photos that have set the internet ablaze. Here’s everything you need to know about Michele Alfieri, his career at UniCredit, and the <em>miccel_a</em> photo leak controversy that’s making waves.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Who Is Michele Alfieri?</h4>



<p>Michele Alfieri is a seasoned professional currently thriving at UniCredit, where he serves in the role of PPM (Portfolio and Project Management) and Business Value Management. Based in Italy, Alfieri’s career trajectory reflects his expertise in navigating the complexities of banking—a field where precision and strategy are paramount. Educated at Università Bocconi, one of Italy’s top universities, and now operating out of Munich as an expat, Alfieri has built a robust network, boasting over 382 connections on LinkedIn. His journey from Italy to Germany exemplifies the global mobility of today’s financial elite, making him a standout figure in UniCredit’s international operations.</p>



<p>But beyond his professional accolades, Alfieri has cultivated an online presence as <em>miccel_a</em>—a handle that’s become synonymous with both his personal brand and, more recently, a shocking scandal. As an expat living abroad, he’s embraced the digital age, but that openness may have come at a cost.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The miccel_a Leaked Photos Scandal</h4>



<p>The buzz around Michele Alfieri took a dramatic turn when compromising photos allegedly linked to his <em>miccel_a</em> persona surfaced online. These leaks, which reportedly depict Alfieri in compromising and personal situations, have thrust the UniCredit executive into an unexpected spotlight. While the authenticity of the photos remains unverified, their emergence has sparked heated discussions across social media platforms, with many speculating about how such a breach could happen to a high-profile expat like Alfieri.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.queerqonnection.com/tag/leaked-photos/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="2" title="leaked photos">leaked photos</a> are said to have originated from a private digital space—possibly a hacked account or a betrayal of trust within his personal circle. For a man whose career hinges on discretion and professionalism, this scandal is a stark contrast to the polished image he’s maintained at UniCredit. The <em>miccel_a</em> moniker, once a casual online identifier, is now at the center of a storm, with search terms like “Michele Alfieri leaked photos” and “miccel_a scandal” spiking in popularity.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How Did This Happen?</h4>



<p>In today’s digital landscape, leaks of compromising photos are not uncommon—especially for public figures or expats navigating life in the spotlight. Michele Alfieri’s case echoes incidents like the 2014 celebrity iCloud hack or the more recent Michele Morrone photo leak from the <em>365 Days</em> set. Whether through a phishing scam, a compromised device, or a trusted confidant gone rogue, the breach of Alfieri’s privacy underscores the vulnerabilities even seasoned professionals face. As an expat living in Munich, far from his native Italy, Alfieri’s dual life—corporate by day, <em>miccel_a</em> by digital footprint—may have made him a target.</p>



<p>At <em>Queer Qonnection</em>, we’ve seen similar stories unfold across Southeast Asia’s expat and celebrity scenes, but Alfieri’s case brings the drama to Europe’s financial hub. Our sources suggest the leaks could have been circulating in underground forums before hitting mainstream attention, a pattern all too familiar in the age of screenshots and shared secrets.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Michele Alfieri at UniCredit: Career Under Scrutiny?</h4>



<p>As the PPM and Business Value Management expert at UniCredit, Michele Alfieri has been instrumental in driving value and efficiency within the organization. UniCredit, headquartered in Milan, is a powerhouse in European banking, and Alfieri’s role places him at the intersection of strategy and execution. But with the <em>miccel_a</em> photo leak scandal breaking, questions arise: will this personal controversy impact his standing at UniCredit?</p>



<p>In a corporate world where reputation is everything, such leaks can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, they risk tarnishing Alfieri’s professional image; on the other, they could humanize him in an era where authenticity is increasingly valued. UniCredit has yet to comment officially, but the expat community in Munich—and indeed, the banking sector—will be watching closely to see how this plays out.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s Next for Michele Alfieri and miccel_a?</h4>



<p>The fallout from the leaked compromising photos remains uncertain. Will Michele Alfieri address the scandal head-on, much like actor Michele Morrone did when his private pics were leaked in 2021, calling it “a big offense”? Or will he let the storm pass quietly, focusing on his work at UniCredit? As <em>miccel_a</em>, Alfieri has a platform to reclaim the narrative, but the choice is his.</p>



<p>For now, the story of Michele Alfieri serves as a cautionary tale for expats and professionals alike: in a world where privacy is fragile, even the most accomplished among us aren’t immune to digital pitfalls. At <em>Queer Qonnection</em>, we’ll keep digging for updates on this sizzling scandal—because if there’s more to uncover about Michele Alfieri or <em>miccel_a</em>, you’ll hear it here first.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stay Tuned for More</h4>



<p>Bookmark us for the latest on Michele Alfieri, the <em>miccel_a</em> photo leak scandal, and all the juiciest stories from the expat and financial worlds. Whether you’re here for the banking insights or the drama, we’ve got you covered. What do you think—will Alfieri rise above this, or is this just the beginning of the <em>miccel_a</em> saga?</p>



<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Michele Alfieri, a UniCredit exec and expat known as <em>miccel_a</em>, is in the spotlight after leaked compromising photos surfaced online, raising questions about his career and privacy in the digital age.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Adam Bakhtiar, the former CNA news presenter with a voice that could make even the most mundane news sound riveting, has been making headlines again—but not for his journalism. This time, it’s for his leaked Grindr photos, his whirlwind marriage, and the whispers of what really goes on behind the scenes in Singapore’s elite circles.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the leaks. Yes, we’ve seen them. Adam’s Grindr photos surfaced earlier this year, and let’s just say, they’ve sparked more than a few conversations. The photos, which show Adam in various states of undress, have left fans and critics alike wondering how the polished news anchor balances his public persona with his private life. But hey, who are we to judge? If anything, it’s a reminder that even the most composed among us have their moments of vulnerability.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Marriage That Flew Under the Radar</strong></h3>



<p>Now, let’s talk about Adam’s marriage. In 2015, Adam tied the knot in a ceremony in Santorini, Greece that, surprisingly, didn’t make the news. Why? Well, the other groom is a regular in <em>Tatler</em> magazine, a publication known for its coverage of high society and the ultra-wealthy. This is the kind of crowd that prefers to keep their celebrations private, away from the prying eyes of the public. And honestly, can you blame them? When you’re part of Singapore’s elite, discretion is key.</p>



<p>But here’s where it gets interesting. The other groom isn’t just a <em>Tatler</em> regular—he’s also a businessman with ties to a family-owned prefab complex. Rumor has it that the family has made good use of government grants to subsidize their businesses. And guess what? The other groom appeared on CNA to talk about this very business. Coincidence? Maybe. But it does make you wonder if Adam pulled a few strings to get his then-husband featured on national television. After all, in Singapore’s tight-knit elite circles, connections are everything.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Divorce: What Really Happened?</strong></h3>



<p>Fast forward five years, and the couple applied for separation. Now, we’re not here to speculate, but it’s hard not to wonder if Adam’s activity on Grindr had anything to do with the marriage ending. After all, finding “fit tops” seems to be a recurring theme in Adam’s life, both on and off the screen.</p>



<p>Adam’s Grindr profile reportedly stated that looks, age, and race didn’t matter—as long as the other person was masculine. While this might sound like an open-minded approach to dating, it’s easy to see how this could cause friction in a marriage. Imagine promising a crowd of your nearest and dearest to come home to the same person every day for the rest of your life, only to find out that your spouse is bringing home a rotating cast of, well, let’s just say,&nbsp;<em>questionable</em>&nbsp;third parties.</p>



<p>Perhaps Adam’s husband didn’t appreciate the “fugly” guests who were now sharing the hole he had vowed to cherish exclusively. It’s one thing to have an open relationship, but it’s another to feel like your home has become a free-for-all. And let’s be real—no one wants to feel like they’re playing second fiddle to a parade of randoms.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Bigger Picture: Wealth, Power, and Privilege</strong></h3>



<p>At the end of the day, Adam Bakhtiar’s story is a reflection of the world he moves in—a world where wealth, power, and privilege often go hand in hand. From <a href="https://www.queerqonnection.com/tag/leaked-photos/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="2" title="leaked photos">leaked photos</a> to high-profile marriages and business ventures, Adam’s life is a reminder that even the most polished exteriors can hide a multitude of secrets.</p>



<p>So, what’s next for Adam? Only time will tell. But one thing’s for sure: whether he’s on the news or in the headlines, Adam Bakhtiar knows how to keep us talking.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Adam Bakhtiar, former CNA news presenter, has been making waves with his leaked Grindr photos and a marriage that flew under the radar. The other groom, a&nbsp;<em>Tatler</em>&nbsp;regular with ties to a family-owned prefab complex, has sparked rumors about government grants and media connections. Five years later, the couple applied for separation, leaving fans to wonder if Adam’s private life played a role. With Adam’s Grindr profile stating that looks, age, and race didn’t matter—as long as the other person was masculine—it’s easy to see how his husband might have felt sidelined. In Singapore’s elite circles, wealth and discretion go hand in hand—but sometimes, the secrets spill out.</p>

<p>If you’ve been anywhere near the internet lately, you’ve probably heard the name Krisna Dwidja. Or maybe you know him as&nbsp;<em>theannalingust</em>&nbsp;on Instagram,&nbsp;<em>xxlasdiandeepthroater</em>&nbsp;on OnlyFans, or&nbsp;<em>francoiszls</em>&nbsp;on LPSG. This Bali-based drag queen isn’t just turning heads—he’s making jaws drop (and not just because of his killer makeup skills).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.queerqonnection.com/tag/leaked-video/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="1" title="Leaked videos">Leaked videos</a> and photos have flooded the web, and let’s just say, Krisna knows how to make a&nbsp;<em>big</em>&nbsp;impression. From swallowing hung men whole to leaving fans begging for more, this scandal is the kind of drama that keeps the internet buzzing. But who is Krisna Dwidja, and why is everyone talking about him? Buckle up, because this story is wilder than a night out in Bali.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong>The Leaks That Shook the Internet</strong></p>



<p>It all started with a few grainy videos. Then, like a domino effect, the floodgates opened. Leaked footage of Krisna Dwidja in action surfaced, and the internet collectively lost its mind. One video shows him working his magic on&nbsp;<em>xxlczech</em>, a well-known figure in the adult entertainment world. Another features&nbsp;<em>redrabbitstories</em>, and let’s just say, Krisna’s throat game is nothing short of legendary.</p>



<p>These leaks didn’t just go viral—they exploded. Forums lit up, social media timelines were flooded, and even mainstream platforms couldn’t ignore the buzz. But here’s the kicker: Krisna didn’t just let the leaks happen. He leaned into the chaos, turning scandal into opportunity.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong>From Bali to OnlyFans: Krisna’s Rise to Fame</strong></p>



<p>Krisna Dwidja isn’t your average drag queen. Sure, he’s got the charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent to slay any stage, but it’s his&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;talents that have people talking. Known for hiring hung men in Singapore to showcase his, ahem,&nbsp;<em>skills</em>, Krisna has built a reputation that’s equal parts glamorous and scandalous.</p>



<p>His Instagram,&nbsp;<em>theannalingust</em>, is a mix of high-fashion drag looks and cheeky teasers that leave fans wanting more. But it’s his OnlyFans,&nbsp;<em>xxlasdiandeepthroater</em>, where the real magic happens. Subscribers get an up-close-and-personal look at Krisna’s infamous throat game, and let’s just say, it’s worth every penny.</p>



<p>And then there’s LPSG, where Krisna goes by&nbsp;<em>francoiszls</em>. This platform has become a hub for fans to discuss his leaked content, share their favorite moments, and speculate about what’s next. It’s a community that’s equal parts obsessed and intrigued, and Krisna is at the center of it all.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong>The Scandal That Changed Everything</strong></p>



<p>Of course, with fame comes drama. The leaked videos and photos weren’t just a shock to fans—they sparked a firestorm of controversy. Some called it a breach of privacy, while others hailed it as the ultimate power move. But one thing’s for sure: Krisna Dwidja knows how to keep people talking.</p>



<p>Allegations flew, rumors spread, and the internet had a field day. Was it a calculated stunt? A revenge plot? Or just the price of fame in the digital age? Whatever the truth, Krisna emerged from the scandal stronger than ever, proving that sometimes, the best publicity is the kind you didn’t ask for.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong>Why Everyone’s Obsessed</strong></p>



<p>Let’s be real: the internet loves a good scandal, and Krisna Dwidja delivers in spades. But it’s not just about the leaks. It’s about the persona, the drama, and the sheer audacity of it all. Krisna isn’t just a drag queen—he’s a force of nature.</p>



<p>His ability to turn controversy into opportunity is unmatched. Whether he’s slaying on stage or breaking the internet with leaked content, Krisna knows how to keep the spotlight on him. And let’s not forget his infamous throat game, which has become the stuff of legend.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong>What’s Next for Krisna Dwidja?</strong></p>

<p>Hey there, and I&#8217;ve got a story that&#8217;s going to make your day! If you&#8217;re into the kind of content that makes you sit up and take notice, then you&#8217;re in for a treat.</p>



<p>Aviel Tan, yes, that Aviel Tan, isn&#8217;t just known for his role at Standard Chartered anymore. This guy, who by day crunches numbers and manages relationships, has another side that&#8217;s been turning heads. His Instagram handle, @saumignonblanc, was where he shared more than just his love for fashion and wine.</p>



<p>Imagine this: a man with a Bachelor&#8217;s in Communications from Nanyang Technological University, who also holds a WSET Level 2 from the Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust, suddenly becomes the talk of the town not for his corporate achievements but for something much&#8230; ahem&#8230; more personal. He was all about showcasing life&#8217;s finer things, and boy, did he have a lot to show!</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s where it gets juicy. Aviel&#8217;s not your average model; he&#8217;s got something special. Let&#8217;s just say his &#8220;eggplant&#8221; has become quite the legend around these parts. And if you&#8217;re wondering, yes, we at queerqonnection.com know exactly where you can get access to those ahem webcam leaks and photos at full arousal. Check out the links below if you&#8217;re curious!</p>



<p>However, just as everyone was starting to lust after this banking model, Aviel decided to play coy. Suddenly, his social media went private. Acting all shy now, are we, Aviel? From being the center of attention to this sudden retreat, it&#8217;s like he&#8217;s playing hard to get with his followers.</p>



<p>What does this mean for Aviel? Well, for starters, his name and his social handle @saumignonblanc are now more than just tags; they&#8217;re keywords that lead straight to intrigue and a bit of scandal. He&#8217;s still at Standard Chartered, per his LinkedIn, which means he&#8217;s balancing this unexpected limelight with his day job. Talk about living life to the fullest while protecting your downsides!</p>



<p>I believe in working hard to play hard, and Aviel seems to embody this ethos. Whether it&#8217;s through his career, his modeling, or his unexpected foray into the world of leaks, he&#8217;s certainly pushing boundaries and challenging norms.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re into that mix of finance, fashion, and a splash of scandal, Aviel Tan is your man. And remember, if you want to see what all the fuss is about, we&#8217;ve got the goods right here at queerqonnection.com.</p>



<p>So, what do you think? Is Aviel just another pretty face, or is there more beneath that polished exterior? Let&#8217;s keep this conversation going, and maybe, just maybe, Aviel will step back into the public eye with a new story to tell.</p>



<p>Check out the links here for more on Aviel Tan&#8217;s adventures.<br><a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qma4aJtxxa7j9fZRWoQtryufBWaTQQy4teCjujAXSAKhdU">https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qma4aJtxxa7j9fZRWoQtryufBWaTQQy4teCjujAXSAKhdU</a></p>
