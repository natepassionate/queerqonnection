<p><em>By Matt, Queer Activist and X Sensation</em><br><em>Published: March 10, 2025</em></p>



<p>In a bold, audacious move that’s shaking up the internet and sparking global conversation, Matt from @QueerQonnection on X recently hosted a gay sex party—dubbed the &#8220;QQsexpar&#8221;—at the luxurious Grand Hyatt Singapore. The twist? This isn’t just another wild night out for the LGBTQ+ community—it’s a brilliant, cheeky, and downright revolutionary protest against the draconian anti-gay laws in Brunei, where homosexuality is punishable by death, imprisonment, or whipping under Sharia law. And here’s the kicker: the Grand Hyatt Singapore is owned by Borneo Properties, which is ultimately controlled by none other than the Sultan of Brunei himself. Let’s unpack why this is the protest we didn’t know we needed—and why it’s going viral.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Setup: A Night of Liberation at the Grand Hyatt</h3>



<p>On March 8, 2025, Matt and his crew transformed a plush suite at the Grand Hyatt Singapore into a haven of queer joy, hosting 13 VIPs ranging from their 20s to 40s. With sleek wooden paneling, a massive day bed (more popular than the King bed, apparently!), and a vibe dripping with defiance, the event skipped the pre-sex games and dove straight into unapologetic celebration. As Matt tweeted, “The day bed was a huge hit! It was even more popular than the actual King bed, and was perennially occupied throughout the session 😜.” The post, complete with a photo of the hotel’s opulent interior, has already racked up thousands of likes, retweets, and heated debates on X.</p>



<p>But this isn’t just about a good time—it’s a strategic middle finger to Brunei’s oppressive regime. The Sultan of Brunei, who owns the Grand Hyatt through his company, Borneo Properties, has long been criticized for enforcing some of the world’s harshest anti-LGBTQ+ laws. In Brunei, gay sex can lead to capital punishment, while lesbian activity is punishable by caning or imprisonment. Meanwhile, the Sultan’s luxury hotel empire—stretching from Singapore to Beverly Hills—rakes in millions, often funded by travelers unaware of the human rights abuses tied to their stays.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Protest: Sex as Resistance</h3>



<p>So, why host a gay orgy at the Sultan’s property? It’s simple, brilliant, and deliciously ironic: by filling the Grand Hyatt Singapore with queer love, laughter, and liberation, Matt and his crew are directly challenging the Sultan’s profits while flipping the script on his oppressive laws. Every dollar spent at the hotel, every room booked, and every event hosted there funnels money back to Brunei’s monarchy. But what if, instead of boycotting, we infiltrate? What if we turn his own luxury empire into a stage for the very acts his regime seeks to erase?</p>



<p>This isn’t just a party—it’s performance art, activism, and a viral moment all rolled into one. By openly celebrating gay sex in a space owned by the Sultan, @QueerQonnection is sending a loud, clear message: “Your laws don’t scare us, and we’ll reclaim your spaces for joy.” It’s the ultimate act of defiance—sexy, subversive, and impossible to ignore.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Backstory: Brunei’s Brutal Laws and the Sultan’s Empire</h3>



<p>Let’s rewind. Brunei, a tiny but oil-rich nation on Borneo, has been under international scrutiny for its anti-LGBTQ+ policies. Since implementing Sharia law in stages starting in 2014, the country has made homosexuality illegal, with punishments ranging from public flogging to death by stoning. In 2019, global outrage erupted when actor George Clooney called for a boycott of Brunei-owned hotels, including the Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air, arguing that staying there directly funds these human rights violations. While boycotts are powerful, Matt’s approach takes it to another level: instead of avoiding these spaces, why not flood them with the very community they seek to oppress?</p>



<p>The Grand Hyatt Singapore, a gleaming symbol of luxury in the heart of the city-state, is part of the Sultan’s sprawling portfolio. Owned by Borneo Properties, it’s a stark contrast to the repression in Brunei, where LGBTQ+ individuals live in fear, often remaining silent and discreet about their identities, as a 2011 University of Brunei study revealed. By hosting an unapologetic gay sex party there, Matt isn’t just having fun—he’s exposing the hypocrisy of a regime that profits from global luxury while denying basic human rights at home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why This Is Going Viral (And Why You Should Join the Conversation)</h3>



<p>This story has all the ingredients for a viral sensation: scandal, sex, luxury, and a David-vs-Goliath battle against oppression. Matt’s X post—complete with a tantalizing photo of the hotel suite, a cheeky mention of lululemon undies, and a call to action for the next QQsexpar on March 29—has already ignited a firestorm. Supporters are hailing it as “genius activism,” while critics are calling it controversial or risky. But that’s the point: it’s sparking debate, forcing people to confront Brunei’s laws, and putting the spotlight on the Sultan’s financial ties to global hospitality.</p>



<p>The hashtag #QQevent is trending, and the story has spread beyond X to mainstream media, with outlets like CNN and The Guardian picking up on the audacity of using sex as protest. People are asking: Is this the future of activism? Can pleasure be a form of resistance? And most importantly, should we all book a room at the Grand Hyatt Singapore for the next QQsexpar?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Bigger Picture: Pleasure as Power</h3>



<p>This isn’t just about one night or one hotel—it’s about reclaiming power in the face of oppression. For too long, LGBTQ+ communities worldwide have been told their love, their bodies, and their joy are wrong. Brunei’s laws are a stark reminder of how far some societies still have to go, but Matt’s QQsexpar shows how far we’ve come in fighting back. By turning a symbol of wealth and control into a space of liberation, @QueerQonnection is rewriting the narrative—and having a damn good time doing it.</p>



<p>Of course, there are risks. Hosting such events in a region where LGBTQ+ rights are still fragile could draw backlash, and the Sultan’s regime isn’t known for its tolerance. But the visibility—and the sheer audacity—might just be what’s needed to push for change. As Matt’s post notes, “QQsexpar Mar 2025 ain’t over yet! Sign up for the 29 Mar sessions HERE.” It’s an invitation to join the revolution, one sexy step at a time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What You Can Do: Get Involved, Spread the Word, and Maybe Book a Room</h3>

</ol>



<p>This isn’t just a story about a party—it’s a call to action. Matt’s QQsexpar at the Grand Hyatt Singapore proves that pleasure can be powerful, that defiance can be delicious, and that sometimes, the best way to fight back is to have the time of your life on the enemy’s turf. Let’s make this go viral—for love, for justice, and for the right to be unapologetically queer.</p>
