<p>Let’s talk about Han Ianto Lee (Han L., Han Lee), aka&nbsp;<em>hackyhan on</em>&nbsp;on Instagram. You’ve probably stumbled across his name recently—maybe because of his time at McKinsey, maybe because of his failed startups, or maybe because of&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;viral video. Yeah, you’ve seen it. The one where he’s hanging out with SK Low and Partner Jason Kuo, having what looks like the time of his life. We’ll get to that. But first, buckle up. Ianto’s story is fascinating, messy, and, well, very human.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stanford Dreams and a Bold Asylum Claim</h3>



<p>Ianto Lee isn’t your average corporate ladder climber. He’s an ex-McKinsey consultant who made headlines for an unusual reason: his political asylum journey. Born in Asia, he sought refuge in the U.S., claiming he was LGBT. A bold move? Absolutely. Controversial? You bet. But it worked. And not just in any low-key, under-the-radar way. He ended up at&nbsp;<em>Stanford University</em>, arguably one of the most prestigious institutions in the world. It’s the kind of story that makes you pause. Not because of the asylum claim itself (that’s his truth to tell), but because of what followed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">From McKinsey Stardom to Startup Woes</h3>



<p>Let’s face it: McKinsey alumni usually have their lives mapped out. They’re supposed to be the golden children of the corporate world. Ianto? He took a different path. After leaving McKinsey, he dived headfirst into the startup world. Ambitious? Sure. Successful? Eh.</p>



<p>He’s the founder of several startups, but here’s the thing—they all flopped. His latest venture,&nbsp;<em>CareForce</em>, had promise on paper. The pitch? Revolutionizing healthcare. But in reality, it never gained traction. Investors weren’t biting, and users didn’t flock to it. Not every startup becomes the next Uber, right? Still, you have to give him credit for trying. Building something from scratch takes guts, even if it doesn’t pan out.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Video Everyone’s Talking About</h3>



<p>Now, about that viral video. You’ve seen the clips. Ianto Lee, SK Low, and Partner Jason Kuo, looking like they’re at a karaoke night meets after-hours boardroom party. It’s the kind of footage that makes you stop scrolling. Are they drunk? Maybe. Are they having a blast? Definitely. Is there tea to spill? Oh, absolutely.</p>



<p>For those of you who haven’t seen it yet (or want to see it again), you know where to look. The photos and videos are floating around—easily accessible if you’ve got the right links. Let’s just say, it’s giving “work hard, play harder” vibes. But here’s the kicker: it’s not just a random night out. It feels like a glimpse into the personality behind the polished LinkedIn profile.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Enigma of Ianto</h3>



<p>What makes Ianto Lee so intriguing isn’t just the asylum claim, the Stanford degree, or the string of failed startups. It’s the contradictions. Here’s a guy who’s been at one of the world’s top consulting firms, tried (and failed) to disrupt industries, and now finds himself in the middle of social media buzz over a leaked video. He’s ambitious but messy, brilliant but flawed. In other words, he’s human.</p>



<p>But let’s not sugarcoat it. His story also raises questions. Was the asylum claim genuine or strategic? Why haven’t his startups taken off despite his McKinsey and Stanford pedigree? And what’s the deal with that video? More importantly, what’s next for him?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why You Should Care</h3>



<p>Here’s the thing:Han Ianto Lee (Han L., Han Lee)’s story isn’t just about him. It’s about the pressures we all feel to “make it,” the risks we take chasing dreams, and the inevitable stumbles along the way. He’s living proof that life doesn’t follow a straight line. Even with the best credentials, the road can be bumpy.</p>



<p>But there’s also something refreshing about his transparency. He’s not hiding behind a curated, flawless image. He’s out there—failures, fun nights, and all. That’s rare in a world where everyone’s obsessed with looking perfect.</p>



<p>So, whether you’re here for the drama, the inspiration, or just to satisfy your curiosity, Han Ianto Lee (Han L., Han Lee) delivers. He’s not a success story (yet), but he’s a story worth watching.</p>



<p>And about that video… you know where to find it. 😉<br><br>Below are photo links and leaks</p>
