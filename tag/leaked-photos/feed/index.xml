<p>Let’s talk about Han Ianto Lee (Han L., Han Lee), aka&nbsp;<em>hackyhan on</em>&nbsp;on Instagram. You’ve probably stumbled across his name recently—maybe because of his time at McKinsey, maybe because of his failed startups, or maybe because of&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;viral video. Yeah, you’ve seen it. The one where he’s hanging out with SK Low and Partner Jason Kuo, having what looks like the time of his life. We’ll get to that. But first, buckle up. Ianto’s story is fascinating, messy, and, well, very human.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stanford Dreams and a Bold Asylum Claim</h3>



<p>Ianto Lee isn’t your average corporate ladder climber. He’s an ex-McKinsey consultant who made headlines for an unusual reason: his political asylum journey. Born in Asia, he sought refuge in the U.S., claiming he was LGBT. A bold move? Absolutely. Controversial? You bet. But it worked. And not just in any low-key, under-the-radar way. He ended up at&nbsp;<em>Stanford University</em>, arguably one of the most prestigious institutions in the world. It’s the kind of story that makes you pause. Not because of the asylum claim itself (that’s his truth to tell), but because of what followed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">From McKinsey Stardom to Startup Woes</h3>



<p>Let’s face it: McKinsey alumni usually have their lives mapped out. They’re supposed to be the golden children of the corporate world. Ianto? He took a different path. After leaving McKinsey, he dived headfirst into the startup world. Ambitious? Sure. Successful? Eh.</p>



<p>He’s the founder of several startups, but here’s the thing—they all flopped. His latest venture,&nbsp;<em>CareForce</em>, had promise on paper. The pitch? Revolutionizing healthcare. But in reality, it never gained traction. Investors weren’t biting, and users didn’t flock to it. Not every startup becomes the next Uber, right? Still, you have to give him credit for trying. Building something from scratch takes guts, even if it doesn’t pan out.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Video Everyone’s Talking About</h3>



<p>Now, about that viral video. You’ve seen the clips. Ianto Lee, SK Low, and Partner Jason Kuo, looking like they’re at a karaoke night meets after-hours boardroom party. It’s the kind of footage that makes you stop scrolling. Are they drunk? Maybe. Are they having a blast? Definitely. Is there tea to spill? Oh, absolutely.</p>



<p>For those of you who haven’t seen it yet (or want to see it again), you know where to look. The photos and videos are floating around—easily accessible if you’ve got the right links. Let’s just say, it’s giving “work hard, play harder” vibes. But here’s the kicker: it’s not just a random night out. It feels like a glimpse into the personality behind the polished LinkedIn profile.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Enigma of Ianto</h3>



<p>What makes Ianto Lee so intriguing isn’t just the asylum claim, the Stanford degree, or the string of failed startups. It’s the contradictions. Here’s a guy who’s been at one of the world’s top consulting firms, tried (and failed) to disrupt industries, and now finds himself in the middle of social media buzz over a leaked video. He’s ambitious but messy, brilliant but flawed. In other words, he’s human.</p>



<p>But let’s not sugarcoat it. His story also raises questions. Was the asylum claim genuine or strategic? Why haven’t his startups taken off despite his McKinsey and Stanford pedigree? And what’s the deal with that video? More importantly, what’s next for him?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why You Should Care</h3>



<p>Here’s the thing:Han Ianto Lee (Han L., Han Lee)’s story isn’t just about him. It’s about the pressures we all feel to “make it,” the risks we take chasing dreams, and the inevitable stumbles along the way. He’s living proof that life doesn’t follow a straight line. Even with the best credentials, the road can be bumpy.</p>



<p>But there’s also something refreshing about his transparency. He’s not hiding behind a curated, flawless image. He’s out there—failures, fun nights, and all. That’s rare in a world where everyone’s obsessed with looking perfect.</p>



<p>So, whether you’re here for the drama, the inspiration, or just to satisfy your curiosity, Han Ianto Lee (Han L., Han Lee) delivers. He’s not a success story (yet), but he’s a story worth watching.</p>



<p>And about that video… you know where to find it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>Below are photo links and leaks</p>

<p>Let’s talk about Velden Neo, also known as Neo Jun Xiong. Or, as his Instagram followers know him,&nbsp;<em>veldenneo</em>. No, that’s not the name of a rock band or an obscure EDM subgenre—it’s the handle of a guy who’s juggling more roles than most of us can even imagine. Lieutenant (LTA) Velden Neo, Second-In-Charge (2IC) of Alpha Company, national serviceman, tutor, and—oh yes—pageant contestant. If that’s not range, I don’t know what is.</p>



<p>And here’s the kicker: he seems to do it all with a candy cane. (We’ll get to that in a moment. Stay with me.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-the-lieutenant-life">The Lieutenant Life</h3>



<p>Currently serving his National Service in Singapore, Velden holds the rank of Lieutenant (LTA). He’s the big deal behind the scenes, the Second-In-Charge (2IC) of Alpha Company. For those unfamiliar with military hierarchy, this basically makes him the right-hand man of the commander, steering the ship and ensuring everything runs smoothly. Think of him as the guy who makes sure the gears don’t jam.</p>



<p>National Service is no walk in the park. Grueling schedules, intense training, and the responsibility of leading other soldiers? That’s a lot to take on. And yet, Velden seems to thrive in this high-pressure environment. Maybe it’s the discipline. Maybe it’s the leadership. Or maybe it’s just his natural&nbsp;<em>swag</em>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-from-the-barracks-to-the-classroom">From the Barracks to the Classroom</h3>



<p>But wait—there’s more to Velden than military life. When he’s not in uniform, he’s busy shaping young minds. Yep, he’s also a tutor. Picture this: the same guy who’s barking orders on the training grounds is patiently explaining algebra to students after hours. That’s got to be some serious mental flexibility.</p>



<p>Let’s be real—tutors are everywhere in Singapore. But Velden? He’s got a unique flair. Maybe it’s the candy cane (yes, we’re back to that). Rumor has it, it’s become a signature move, a quirky prop that makes his sessions not just educational but also fun. Who wouldn’t want to solve quadratic equations when there’s a candy cane involved? And let’s not ignore the obvious: a guy who’s both a soldier and a pageant contestant? That’s got to make math class a little more interesting. There are videos of him stroking that candy cane on camera. But of course Velden has had them removed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-the-pageant-phase">The Pageant Phase</h3>



<p>Speaking of pageants, did we mention that Velden once graced the stage as a pageant contestant? That’s right—this guy doesn’t just lead troops and tutor kids; he’s also strutted his stuff in front of an audience. Pageants aren’t just about looks (although let’s be honest, he’s got that covered too). They’re also about confidence, charisma, and the ability to connect with people. Velden brought all that and more.</p>



<p>For those of you dying to see what that looked like, well, you know where to go. The photos and videos you’re looking for? They’re just a few clicks away. Check out his Instagram,&nbsp;<em>veldenneo</em>, and dive into the archives. You didn’t hear it from me, but it’s worth the scroll.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-a-modern-day-renaissance-man">A Modern-Day Renaissance Man</h3>



<p>At this point, you’re probably wondering: how does he do it all? Lieutenant. Tutor. Pageant contestant. It’s like he’s living three lives at once. And yet, he makes it look effortless.</p>



<p>Maybe it’s the discipline he’s honed in the army. Maybe it’s the adaptability he’s developed as a tutor. Or maybe it’s just who he is—a multitasker with a knack for excelling in everything he does.</p>



<p>Whatever the secret sauce is, one thing’s clear: Velden Neo is not your average guy. He’s a modern-day Renaissance man, balancing responsibility and creativity, discipline and flair. Whether he’s leading a company, teaching kids, or owning the stage, he brings his A-game every single time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-want-more">Want More?</h3>



<p>Let’s be honest—you’re curious now. You want to see the photos. You want to watch the videos. You want to know what this candy cane business is all about. Lucky for you, the answers are just a few taps away. Head over to Instagram and follow&nbsp;<em>veldenneo</em>. Because trust me, this is a guy you’re going to want to keep an eye on.</p>



<p>Velden Neo: soldier, teacher, pageant king, and maybe even a little bit of a magician. Who else could make a candy cane so iconic?</p>

<p>Bryan C. Mak is not your typical internet personality. One moment, he’s helping families navigate the complexities of genetic conditions as a counselor at Genome Medical. The next, he’s lighting up OnlyFans as&nbsp;<em>Showofftwunk</em>&nbsp;or dropping sass and wit on X (formerly Twitter) under his handles&nbsp;<em>bryseq</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>xialongbry</em>. It’s a fascinating blend of science, self-expression, and unapologetic authenticity—and people can’t seem to get enough of him. So, who exactly is Bryan Mak, and why is his name cropping up everywhere from genetic counseling forums to spicy OnlyFans discussions? Let’s dive in.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Day Job: Genetic and Pediatric Counseling at Genome Medical</h3>



<p>By day, Bryan Mak is a genetic and pediatric counselor, a role that’s as brainy as it is compassionate. At Genome Medical, he helps families make sense of genetic conditions, navigating everything from hereditary risks to rare disorders. It’s high-stakes work. Imagine sitting down with a family and explaining the genetic likelihood of a child inheriting a condition—or helping someone understand what their DNA says about their future health.</p>



<p>This isn’t just a job where you throw around fancy science terms. It’s about empathy and clarity, about breaking down dense medical knowledge into something digestible for people who are scared, confused, or just searching for answers. That’s where Bryan’s skill shines. He’s not just about the data—he’s about the people. And let’s be honest, that’s a rare quality in any career, let alone one as technical as genetic counseling.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Online Persona:&nbsp;<em>Showofftwunk</em>&nbsp;on OnlyFans</h3>



<p>But let’s talk about the other side of Bryan Mak—the side that’s got people Googling&nbsp;<em>“Bryan Mak’s OF profile”</em>. Under the name&nbsp;<em>Showofftwunk</em>, Bryan has cultivated a space on OnlyFans that’s equal parts cheeky and confident. He’s not afraid to put himself out there—literally and figuratively—and it’s this openness that has earned him a growing fanbase.</p>



<p>What makes it interesting is the contrast. By day, he’s a professional working in one of the most intellectually challenging fields out there. By night (and let’s be honest, probably weekends too), he’s creating content that’s bold, body-positive, and completely unfiltered. The name&nbsp;<em>Showofftwunk</em>&nbsp;itself is a playful nod to his self-image: a mix of “show-off” confidence and “twunk,” a term that falls somewhere between “twink” and “hunk.” It’s tongue-in-cheek, but it’s also self-assured.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">X Marks the Spot:&nbsp;<em>Bryseq</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Xialongbry</em>&nbsp;on Social Media</h3>



<p>If you’re not following Bryan on X (formerly Twitter), you’re missing out on a whole other side of his personality. Under the handles&nbsp;<em>bryseq</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>xialongbry</em>, he shares everything from sharp-witted takes on current events to glimpses into his personal life. It’s a mix of humor, insight, and the kind of candidness that makes social media actually fun to scroll through.</p>



<p>What’s particularly striking about his social media presence is how multifaceted it is. One minute, he’s geeking out over a new genetic discovery. The next, he’s sharing a thirst trap that has his followers collectively losing their minds. It’s not just content—it’s a full spectrum of who he is, and that’s what makes it so engaging.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Appeal of Bryan Mak</h3>



<p>So why are people so fascinated with Bryan? It’s not just the duality of his life—though that’s definitely part of it. It’s the way he owns every part of himself. He’s not trying to fit into a neat little box. He’s a genetic counselor who’s great at his job, a content creator who’s unapologetically himself, and a social media personality who knows how to keep things interesting.</p>



<p>In a world where people are often told to pick a lane, Bryan’s out here building his own highway. He’s proving that you can be smart, sexy, and multidimensional all at once. And honestly? That’s inspiring.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Searching for More?</h3>



<p>If you’re here because you Googled&nbsp;<em>“Bryan Mak revealed”</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>“Bryan Mak’s OF profile”</em>, you’re not alone. Curiosity about his life is growing, and for good reason. Whether you’re interested in his work as a genetic counselor, his OnlyFans content as&nbsp;<em>Showofftwunk</em>, or his sharp social media presence as&nbsp;<em>bryseq</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>xialongbry</em>, one thing’s clear: Bryan Mak is a name worth knowing.</p>



<p>So, what’s next for Bryan? Only time (and maybe his next post) will tell. But<br><br>Find his more revealing pictures and videos</p>

<p>In today’s fast-paced global economy, staying ahead of trends and adapting to changing dynamics is crucial. Carlos Casanova, a prominent economist and director at UBP (Union Bancaire Privée) in Hong Kong, has made a significant mark in the financial world, particularly in the field of private banking. As a leading economist in the region, Casanova&#8217;s insights into economic trends and his strategic outlook for Hong Kong and broader global markets are highly valued by both clients and peers alike.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Who is Carlos Casanova?</h3>



<p>Carlos Casanova is a well-respected economist and director at UBP, one of the world’s leading private banks. Based in Hong Kong, his role involves analyzing complex economic trends across Asia and beyond, offering critical insights that help shape the bank’s strategy in the region. With a deep understanding of financial markets, Carlos brings years of experience in economic forecasting, risk analysis, and investment strategy.</p>



<p>His expertise spans a range of sectors, including macroeconomics, global trade, and market behavior. Casanova&#8217;s ability to decode intricate economic patterns and his forward-thinking perspective on emerging markets have positioned him as one of the top financial minds in Asia. His work has earned him recognition as an influential thought leader in the fields of private banking and economics.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Changing Economic Landscape in Asia</h3>



<p>Under Carlos Casanova&#8217;s direction, UBP has excelled in providing strategic advice to high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in Asia, especially in Hong Kong. As one of the financial hubs of the world, Hong Kong remains a focal point for international investors. However, as global uncertainties increase, from trade tensions to geopolitical risks, the need for nuanced insights has never been more vital.</p>



<p>Carlos’s recent analysis focuses on navigating these complexities and seizing opportunities within Asia. His view of the &#8220;Visiting Bottom&#8221; in markets is of particular note. In this context, the term refers to an economic cycle or period when markets or sectors reach a low point before they begin to recover. Casanova’s expertise has allowed his clients to strategically position themselves during such periods, minimizing risks and maximizing returns when the market rebounds.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">“Visiting Bottom” – A Key Concept in Economic Strategy</h3>



<p>The &#8220;Visiting Bottom&#8221; concept is an important framework that Carlos Casanova often discusses with his clients. It refers to understanding when an asset or sector has hit a temporary low, and strategically capitalizing on the opportunity to buy before recovery takes place. In markets as volatile as those in Asia, pinpointing such moments requires deep market analysis, intuition, and a keen understanding of global economic trends.</p>



<p>Casanova emphasizes the importance of staying informed during such cycles, as the potential for market turnaround can present lucrative opportunities for investors with the right strategy. His work highlights how a thoughtful and well-executed plan can help investors take advantage of these market lows, reducing risk while positioning themselves for future gains.</p>
