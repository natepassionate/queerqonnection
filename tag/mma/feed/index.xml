<p>Let’s talk about Velden Neo, also known as Neo Jun Xiong. Or, as his Instagram followers know him,&nbsp;<em>veldenneo</em>. No, that’s not the name of a rock band or an obscure EDM subgenre—it’s the handle of a guy who’s juggling more roles than most of us can even imagine. Lieutenant (LTA) Velden Neo, Second-In-Charge (2IC) of Alpha Company, national serviceman, tutor, and—oh yes—pageant contestant. If that’s not range, I don’t know what is.</p>



<p>And here’s the kicker: he seems to do it all with a candy cane. (We’ll get to that in a moment. Stay with me.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-the-lieutenant-life">The Lieutenant Life</h3>



<p>Currently serving his National Service in Singapore, Velden holds the rank of Lieutenant (LTA). He’s the big deal behind the scenes, the Second-In-Charge (2IC) of Alpha Company. For those unfamiliar with military hierarchy, this basically makes him the right-hand man of the commander, steering the ship and ensuring everything runs smoothly. Think of him as the guy who makes sure the gears don’t jam.</p>



<p>National Service is no walk in the park. Grueling schedules, intense training, and the responsibility of leading other soldiers? That’s a lot to take on. And yet, Velden seems to thrive in this high-pressure environment. Maybe it’s the discipline. Maybe it’s the leadership. Or maybe it’s just his natural&nbsp;<em>swag</em>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-from-the-barracks-to-the-classroom">From the Barracks to the Classroom</h3>



<p>But wait—there’s more to Velden than military life. When he’s not in uniform, he’s busy shaping young minds. Yep, he’s also a tutor. Picture this: the same guy who’s barking orders on the training grounds is patiently explaining algebra to students after hours. That’s got to be some serious mental flexibility.</p>



<p>Let’s be real—tutors are everywhere in Singapore. But Velden? He’s got a unique flair. Maybe it’s the candy cane (yes, we’re back to that). Rumor has it, it’s become a signature move, a quirky prop that makes his sessions not just educational but also fun. Who wouldn’t want to solve quadratic equations when there’s a candy cane involved? And let’s not ignore the obvious: a guy who’s both a soldier and a pageant contestant? That’s got to make math class a little more interesting. There are videos of him stroking that candy cane on camera. But of course Velden has had them removed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-the-pageant-phase">The Pageant Phase</h3>



<p>Speaking of pageants, did we mention that Velden once graced the stage as a pageant contestant? That’s right—this guy doesn’t just lead troops and tutor kids; he’s also strutted his stuff in front of an audience. Pageants aren’t just about looks (although let’s be honest, he’s got that covered too). They’re also about confidence, charisma, and the ability to connect with people. Velden brought all that and more.</p>



<p>For those of you dying to see what that looked like, well, you know where to go. The photos and videos you’re looking for? They’re just a few clicks away. Check out his Instagram,&nbsp;<em>veldenneo</em>, and dive into the archives. You didn’t hear it from me, but it’s worth the scroll.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-a-modern-day-renaissance-man">A Modern-Day Renaissance Man</h3>



<p>At this point, you’re probably wondering: how does he do it all? Lieutenant. Tutor. Pageant contestant. It’s like he’s living three lives at once. And yet, he makes it look effortless.</p>



<p>Maybe it’s the discipline he’s honed in the army. Maybe it’s the adaptability he’s developed as a tutor. Or maybe it’s just who he is—a multitasker with a knack for excelling in everything he does.</p>



<p>Whatever the secret sauce is, one thing’s clear: Velden Neo is not your average guy. He’s a modern-day Renaissance man, balancing responsibility and creativity, discipline and flair. Whether he’s leading a company, teaching kids, or owning the stage, he brings his A-game every single time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-want-more">Want More?</h3>



<p>Let’s be honest—you’re curious now. You want to see the photos. You want to watch the videos. You want to know what this candy cane business is all about. Lucky for you, the answers are just a few taps away. Head over to Instagram and follow&nbsp;<em>veldenneo</em>. Because trust me, this is a guy you’re going to want to keep an eye on.</p>



<p>Velden Neo: soldier, teacher, pageant king, and maybe even a little bit of a magician. Who else could make a candy cane so iconic?</p>
