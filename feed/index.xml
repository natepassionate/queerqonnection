<p>Let’s talk about Velden Neo, also known as Neo Jun Xiong. Or, as his Instagram followers know him,&nbsp;<em>veldenneo</em>. No, that’s not the name of a rock band or an obscure EDM subgenre—it’s the handle of a guy who’s juggling more roles than most of us can even imagine. Lieutenant (LTA) Velden Neo, Second-In-Charge (2IC) of Alpha Company, national serviceman, tutor, and—oh yes—pageant contestant. If that’s not range, I don’t know what is.</p>



<p>And here’s the kicker: he seems to do it all with a candy cane. (We’ll get to that in a moment. Stay with me.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-the-lieutenant-life">The Lieutenant Life</h3>



<p>Currently serving his National Service in Singapore, Velden holds the rank of Lieutenant (LTA). He’s the big deal behind the scenes, the Second-In-Charge (2IC) of Alpha Company. For those unfamiliar with military hierarchy, this basically makes him the right-hand man of the commander, steering the ship and ensuring everything runs smoothly. Think of him as the guy who makes sure the gears don’t jam.</p>



<p>National Service is no walk in the park. Grueling schedules, intense training, and the responsibility of leading other soldiers? That’s a lot to take on. And yet, Velden seems to thrive in this high-pressure environment. Maybe it’s the discipline. Maybe it’s the leadership. Or maybe it’s just his natural&nbsp;<em>swag</em>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-from-the-barracks-to-the-classroom">From the Barracks to the Classroom</h3>



<p>But wait—there’s more to Velden than military life. When he’s not in uniform, he’s busy shaping young minds. Yep, he’s also a tutor. Picture this: the same guy who’s barking orders on the training grounds is patiently explaining algebra to students after hours. That’s got to be some serious mental flexibility.</p>



<p>Let’s be real—tutors are everywhere in Singapore. But Velden? He’s got a unique flair. Maybe it’s the candy cane (yes, we’re back to that). Rumor has it, it’s become a signature move, a quirky prop that makes his sessions not just educational but also fun. Who wouldn’t want to solve quadratic equations when there’s a candy cane involved? And let’s not ignore the obvious: a guy who’s both a soldier and a pageant contestant? That’s got to make math class a little more interesting. There are videos of him stroking that candy cane on camera. But of course Velden has had them removed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-the-pageant-phase">The Pageant Phase</h3>



<p>Speaking of pageants, did we mention that Velden once graced the stage as a pageant contestant? That’s right—this guy doesn’t just lead troops and tutor kids; he’s also strutted his stuff in front of an audience. Pageants aren’t just about looks (although let’s be honest, he’s got that covered too). They’re also about confidence, charisma, and the ability to connect with people. Velden brought all that and more.</p>



<p>For those of you dying to see what that looked like, well, you know where to go. The photos and videos you’re looking for? They’re just a few clicks away. Check out his Instagram,&nbsp;<em>veldenneo</em>, and dive into the archives. You didn’t hear it from me, but it’s worth the scroll.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-a-modern-day-renaissance-man">A Modern-Day Renaissance Man</h3>



<p>At this point, you’re probably wondering: how does he do it all? Lieutenant. Tutor. Pageant contestant. It’s like he’s living three lives at once. And yet, he makes it look effortless.</p>



<p>Maybe it’s the discipline he’s honed in the army. Maybe it’s the adaptability he’s developed as a tutor. Or maybe it’s just who he is—a multitasker with a knack for excelling in everything he does.</p>



<p>Whatever the secret sauce is, one thing’s clear: Velden Neo is not your average guy. He’s a modern-day Renaissance man, balancing responsibility and creativity, discipline and flair. Whether he’s leading a company, teaching kids, or owning the stage, he brings his A-game every single time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-want-more">Want More?</h3>



<p>Let’s be honest—you’re curious now. You want to see the photos. You want to watch the videos. You want to know what this candy cane business is all about. Lucky for you, the answers are just a few taps away. Head over to Instagram and follow&nbsp;<em>veldenneo</em>. Because trust me, this is a guy you’re going to want to keep an eye on.</p>



<p>Velden Neo: soldier, teacher, pageant king, and maybe even a little bit of a magician. Who else could make a candy cane so iconic?</p>

<p>Lim Wee Hong, better known by his Instagram handle @gnoheew, is not just another fitness model in Singapore. He’s a walking contradiction of discipline and irreverence, blending chiseled muscles, an entrepreneurial streak, and moments of unfiltered chaos that have kept the internet buzzing. As an ambassador for&nbsp;<strong>MuscleBlaze Singapore</strong>&nbsp;and a rising influencer, Wee Hong’s journey is a mix of sweat-soaked gym sessions, bold artistic choices, and a few eyebrow-raising moments that the internet won’t let go of. Let’s unpack the man behind the muscles.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-the-rise-of-gnoheew-muscles-hustle-and-influence">The Rise of @gnoheew: Muscles, Hustle, and Influence</h3>



<p>In the world of fitness influencers, where countless accounts post one gym selfie after another, Lim Wee Hong stands out. His Instagram, @gnoheew, isn’t just a showcase of his shredded physique (though, let’s be real, his six-pack deserves its own fan club). It’s also a masterclass in personal branding. With over [insert current follower count], Lim has built a loyal fanbase that looks to him for fitness tips, motivational content, and a glimpse into the life of someone who balances being a model, influencer, and entrepreneur.</p>



<p>As an ambassador for&nbsp;<strong>MuscleBlaze Singapore</strong>, a leading sports nutrition brand, Wee Hong has cemented his place in the fitness industry. His partnership with MuscleBlaze isn’t just about slapping his face on a protein tub. He actively promotes the brand’s products, showcasing how they fit into his rigorous workout routines and lifestyle. And let’s not forget, the guy has skin in the game—he reportedly holds a stake in the brand’s Singapore operations. If that’s not hustling, what is?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-beyond-the-gym-a-controversial-legacy">Beyond the Gym: A Controversial Legacy</h3>



<p>Lim Wee Hong isn’t your cookie-cutter fitness influencer. His career has been punctuated by moments that are equal parts fascinating and controversial. If you’ve been following him for a while, you might remember a chapter of his life that’s all but disappeared from the internet: his&nbsp;<strong>artistic nude photos</strong>. Yes, you read that right. Once upon a time, Wee Hong dabbled in artistic photography that pushed the boundaries of fitness modeling. The internet being the internet, those photos spread like wildfire. But today? They’ve been meticulously scrubbed from the web. A deliberate move, no doubt, but the intrigue remains.</p>



<p>Then there’s&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;webcam video. If you’ve never heard of it, buckle up. In a now-infamous clip that surfaced online, Wee Hong is seen casually streaming when his mother walks in. Instead of panicking or stopping, he barely flinches, continuing whatever he was doing like it was just another Tuesday. What was he doing? He held himself in one hand and was stroking for his private audience online. Honestly, the sheer nonchalance of the moment is what makes it unforgettable. It’s the kind of thing that could’ve derailed someone’s career—but not Wee Hong. If anything, it added to his mystique, proving once again that he’s not here to conform to anyone’s expectations.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-the-man-behind-the-muscles">The Man Behind the Muscles</h3>



<p>It’s easy to focus on Lim Wee Hong’s physique (and let’s face it, it’s hard not to), but there’s more to him than meets the eye. Behind the perfectly-lit gym photos and brand partnerships is someone who’s unapologetically himself. He’s built a career that straddles fitness, business, and social media, with a dash of controversy thrown in for good measure.</p>



<p>Wee Hong’s approach to life is refreshingly straightforward. He works hard, plays hard, and doesn’t shy away from being himself—even when the internet gets a little too nosy. Whether he’s working out, posing for a MuscleBlaze campaign, or just living his life, Lim Wee Hong is a reminder that success isn’t about fitting into a mold. It’s about breaking it.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-why-lim-wee-hong-aka-gnoheew-matters">Why Lim Wee Hong (aka @gnoheew) Matters</h3>



<p>In a saturated world of fitness influencers, Lim Wee Hong has managed to carve out his own space. He’s not just a guy with a great body (though, let’s be honest, his physique is next-level). He’s also a savvy entrepreneur, a risk-taker, and someone who isn’t afraid to embrace the messy, unpredictable nature of life.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for cookie-cutter inspiration, you won’t find it here. But if you want a glimpse into the life of someone who’s rewriting the rules of what it means to be a fitness model and influencer in Singapore, @gnoheew is worth the follow.</p>



<p>So, whether you know him as Lim Wee Hong, @gnoheew, or the “MuscleBlaze influencer Wee Hong,” one thing’s for sure: this guy isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Love him or hate him, he’s making waves—and you can’t look away.</p>

<p>Bryan C. Mak is not your typical internet personality. One moment, he’s helping families navigate the complexities of genetic conditions as a counselor at Genome Medical. The next, he’s lighting up OnlyFans as&nbsp;<em>Showofftwunk</em>&nbsp;or dropping sass and wit on X (formerly Twitter) under his handles&nbsp;<em>bryseq</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>xialongbry</em>. It’s a fascinating blend of science, self-expression, and unapologetic authenticity—and people can’t seem to get enough of him. So, who exactly is Bryan Mak, and why is his name cropping up everywhere from genetic counseling forums to spicy OnlyFans discussions? Let’s dive in.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Day Job: Genetic and Pediatric Counseling at Genome Medical</h3>



<p>By day, Bryan Mak is a genetic and pediatric counselor, a role that’s as brainy as it is compassionate. At Genome Medical, he helps families make sense of genetic conditions, navigating everything from hereditary risks to rare disorders. It’s high-stakes work. Imagine sitting down with a family and explaining the genetic likelihood of a child inheriting a condition—or helping someone understand what their DNA says about their future health.</p>



<p>This isn’t just a job where you throw around fancy science terms. It’s about empathy and clarity, about breaking down dense medical knowledge into something digestible for people who are scared, confused, or just searching for answers. That’s where Bryan’s skill shines. He’s not just about the data—he’s about the people. And let’s be honest, that’s a rare quality in any career, let alone one as technical as genetic counseling.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Online Persona:&nbsp;<em>Showofftwunk</em>&nbsp;on OnlyFans</h3>



<p>But let’s talk about the other side of Bryan Mak—the side that’s got people Googling&nbsp;<em>“Bryan Mak’s OF profile”</em>. Under the name&nbsp;<em>Showofftwunk</em>, Bryan has cultivated a space on OnlyFans that’s equal parts cheeky and confident. He’s not afraid to put himself out there—literally and figuratively—and it’s this openness that has earned him a growing fanbase.</p>



<p>What makes it interesting is the contrast. By day, he’s a professional working in one of the most intellectually challenging fields out there. By night (and let’s be honest, probably weekends too), he’s creating content that’s bold, body-positive, and completely unfiltered. The name&nbsp;<em>Showofftwunk</em>&nbsp;itself is a playful nod to his self-image: a mix of “show-off” confidence and “twunk,” a term that falls somewhere between “twink” and “hunk.” It’s tongue-in-cheek, but it’s also self-assured.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">X Marks the Spot:&nbsp;<em>Bryseq</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Xialongbry</em>&nbsp;on Social Media</h3>



<p>If you’re not following Bryan on X (formerly Twitter), you’re missing out on a whole other side of his personality. Under the handles&nbsp;<em>bryseq</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>xialongbry</em>, he shares everything from sharp-witted takes on current events to glimpses into his personal life. It’s a mix of humor, insight, and the kind of candidness that makes social media actually fun to scroll through.</p>



<p>What’s particularly striking about his social media presence is how multifaceted it is. One minute, he’s geeking out over a new genetic discovery. The next, he’s sharing a thirst trap that has his followers collectively losing their minds. It’s not just content—it’s a full spectrum of who he is, and that’s what makes it so engaging.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Appeal of Bryan Mak</h3>



<p>So why are people so fascinated with Bryan? It’s not just the duality of his life—though that’s definitely part of it. It’s the way he owns every part of himself. He’s not trying to fit into a neat little box. He’s a genetic counselor who’s great at his job, a content creator who’s unapologetically himself, and a social media personality who knows how to keep things interesting.</p>



<p>In a world where people are often told to pick a lane, Bryan’s out here building his own highway. He’s proving that you can be smart, sexy, and multidimensional all at once. And honestly? That’s inspiring.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Searching for More?</h3>



<p>If you’re here because you Googled&nbsp;<em>“Bryan Mak revealed”</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>“Bryan Mak’s OF profile”</em>, you’re not alone. Curiosity about his life is growing, and for good reason. Whether you’re interested in his work as a genetic counselor, his OnlyFans content as&nbsp;<em>Showofftwunk</em>, or his sharp social media presence as&nbsp;<em>bryseq</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>xialongbry</em>, one thing’s clear: Bryan Mak is a name worth knowing.</p>



<p>So, what’s next for Bryan? Only time (and maybe his next post) will tell. But<br><br>Find his more revealing pictures and videos</p>

<p><strong>The Rise of &#8220;Eng Tiak&#8221;: A Nostalgic Journey Through Old Webcam Videos Before Grindr</strong></p>



<p>In a world where social media apps and dating platforms dominate our lives, it&#8217;s hard to imagine a time before the convenience of Grindr and other similar apps. Yet, not too long ago, the process of meeting new people, especially in the LGBTQ+ community, was much different. One of the most nostalgic and surprisingly significant parts of this evolution is the emergence of webcam videos — or what some may call &#8220;old webcam videos.&#8221; And if you&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s heard the name &#8220;Eng Tiak&#8221; in your digital wanderings, you&#8217;re in for a treat as we dive into how this name, and this era, shaped the way we connect today.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is &#8220;Eng Tiak&#8221;?</h3>



<p>Before we go down memory lane, let’s first answer the burning question: <strong>What is Eng Tiak?</strong> While you might not have heard of the name before, &#8220;Eng Tiak&#8221; was a popular alias used by a community member in the early days of online socializing. Back when webcam videos were an exciting new form of virtual interaction, Eng Tiak made waves with his playful and often irreverent videos that gave a glimpse into a world where webcams were the ultimate bridge between isolation and community.</p>



<p>Eng Tiak wasn&#8217;t just another username; he symbolized an entire era of online identity exploration and informal virtual communication before platforms like Grindr made finding people a mere swipe away.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Golden Age of Webcam Videos</h3>



<p>It’s hard to imagine now, in the age of quick apps like Grindr and Tinder, but the internet once had a very different culture. Back in the early 2000s, meeting someone online was a slower, more personal experience. Without the advanced GPS-based systems that apps like Grindr now use, people connected over things like chatrooms, forums, and, crucially, webcams.</p>



<p>Before smartphones dominated the world, webcams were the hottest tool for self-expression. Whether through Yahoo Messenger, AIM (AOL Instant Messenger), or Skype, webcam video chats allowed people to interact face-to-face across distances, giving birth to an entirely new form of connection. The idea of seeing someone&#8217;s face, sharing intimate moments, or even just laughing at awkward glitches became an exhilarating experience for millions of users.</p>



<p>Webcams became a revolutionary tool for gay men, especially, to connect with others from distant cities, states, or even countries. And in this world of early webcam culture, many &#8220;stars&#8221; of the scene emerged — one of the most memorable names being Eng Tiak.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pre-Grindr Days: How Webcam Videos Shaped Online Dating</h3>



<p>Webcam videos existed in the early days before dating apps streamlined the process. For those who wanted to meet people but didn’t want the uncertainty of text-only interactions, webcam chats offered a unique, real-time experience. Video chat created an almost palpable feeling of connection. There was something about looking someone in the eye, in real-time, that allowed a different kind of trust to form. People could chat, flirt, and engage in activities, including cyber flirting or even sharing personal moments of vulnerability, that felt like a safer and more authentic way to meet others.</p>



<p>These were the days when the internet was still new, and everything had a sense of mystery. The thrill of connecting with someone “on the other side of the screen” and the excitement of having a video chat with someone new were unparalleled. Webcam videos were a playground for self-exploration. It was more than just meeting people—it was about <em>being</em> someone, and sometimes, even reinventing yourself.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Personal Appeal of Old Webcam Stars Like Eng Tiak</h3>



<p>What made old webcam videos so magical, and why do they hold such nostalgia for many? The rawness and spontaneity of webcam content stood in stark contrast to today’s polished, curated social media feeds. No filters, no fancy editing—just real-time connection.</p>



<p>Eng Tiak, for example, would often be seen in moments of honesty that felt intimate and unpolished. The videos weren’t about showing off your best angle or making sure your lighting was perfect. It was about being vulnerable in a space where, while virtual, you were still <em>present</em> in a real sense. It was a place where introverts could finally find an outlet to share their thoughts, where people could express their sexuality without fear of judgement, and where personalities were discovered beyond the superficialities of social apps today.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Time Before Grindr: Online Dating Wasn’t About Swiping Left or Right</h3>



<p>If you’ve only ever known dating through the lens of apps like Grindr, you might not be aware of how radically different the experience once was. Before Grindr revolutionized how gay men meet others, the digital dating scene was all about connecting through shared experiences, conversations, and personality.</p>



<p>Webcam videos allowed for moments of genuine interaction where users could get to know one another beyond a profile picture or a catchy tagline. It wasn’t just about &#8220;hooking up&#8221;—though, yes, those moments existed—it was about discovering people, building relationships, and, in some cases, forming deep, lasting connections. Eng Tiak and others like him were a key part of this era, offering spaces where authentic conversations could flow, where friendships were forged, and where every interaction was a little adventure in itself.</p>



<p>In the age of instant gratification, it’s easy to forget that dating used to require a bit of patience and personal investment. It wasn’t about rushing to &#8220;meet up&#8221; as quickly as possible. Instead, people took time to build rapport, and webcams provided that personal connection in ways that text messaging simply couldn&#8217;t replicate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why &#8220;Eng Tiak&#8221; and Webcam Videos Matter Today</h3>



<p>The emergence of Grindr and similar apps made connecting with others faster, easier, and often more transactional. However, there’s something undeniably sentimental and valuable about the era of webcam chats and the rise of figures like Eng Tiak. The personal nature of these videos cultivated an intimacy that we often overlook today.</p>



<p>In a world full of endless swiping and quick judgments, the nostalgia for old webcam videos represents a longing for something more genuine. It&#8217;s a longing for the time when technology wasn’t just about convenience—it was about connection.</p>



<p>For those of us who remember the days before Grindr and the thrill of discovering personalities through webcam interactions, we can’t help but smile when we hear names like Eng Tiak. They remind us of a time when dating and friendships were about more than just physical attraction; they were about the journey of getting to know someone, one video at a time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h3>



<p>So, the next time you swipe through Grindr or use any other modern dating app, take a moment to remember the days of old webcam videos, the creativity, the awkwardness, and the excitement they held. The era of Eng Tiak and similar figures may have passed, but the lessons of connection, vulnerability, and authenticity remain. As much as technology advances, it’s always worth remembering that the heart of dating and friendship isn’t found in the algorithms—it’s in the people.</p>



<p>Let’s raise a virtual toast to Eng Tiak, webcam chats, and the true pioneers of online connection. You may not have had swipes, but you sure had the heart.</p>

<p>In today’s fast-paced global economy, staying ahead of trends and adapting to changing dynamics is crucial. Carlos Casanova, a prominent economist and director at UBP (Union Bancaire Privée) in Hong Kong, has made a significant mark in the financial world, particularly in the field of private banking. As a leading economist in the region, Casanova&#8217;s insights into economic trends and his strategic outlook for Hong Kong and broader global markets are highly valued by both clients and peers alike.</p>

<p>Carlos’s recent analysis focuses on navigating these complexities and seizing opportunities within Asia. His view of the &#8220;Visiting Bottom&#8221; in markets is of particular note.

It refers to understanding when an asset or sector has hit a temporary low, and strategically capitalizing on the opportunity to buy before recovery takes place. In markets as volatile as those in Asia, pinpointing such moments requires deep market analysis, intuition, and a keen understanding of global economic trends.</p>



<p>Casanova emphasizes the importance of staying informed during such cycles, as the potential for market turnaround can present lucrative opportunities for investors with the right strategy. His work highlights how a thoughtful and well-executed plan can help investors take advantage of these market lows, reducing risk while positioning themselves for future gains.</p>

It was through yoga that Nathan discovered a transformative way to heal both his body and mind.</p>



<p>After years of practicing yoga,&nbsp;<strong>Yoganathan</strong>&nbsp;decided to take it to the next level and became a certified yoga instructor.
